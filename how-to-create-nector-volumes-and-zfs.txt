Extending instance volume in Nectar and zfs
1
1.1. In the Nectar dashboard, create volume  and enter the details, eg name, size and leave defaults (In Volumes tab, click on +Create Volume)
1.2. After the volume has been created, in Actions,  select Manage Attachments
1.3. Assign the volume to the target instance.
1.4. Done (note the device name the volume is assigned to the instance, eg /dev/vdc)

Adding the volume (device) in zfs pool on the instance.
2
2.1. ssh to the instance in question
2.2.  Do: sudo fdisk -l | grep dev
    This will list all the devices (disks) in the instance)
    You should see the volume (disks) you have just attached to this instance in the Nectar dashbouard (e..g Disk /dev/vdd: 214.7 GB, 214748364800 bytes)
2.3. Do: sudo zpool add -f data /dev/devicename (where devicename is the disk you have attached, e.g /dev/vdd)
   (Note: To create new pool and attach dev to it: sudo zpool create -f mydata /dev/vdb)
   (Note: To install zfs on a instance (assume Ubunt 16.04:
    sudo apt install zfs
    Create pool named, e.g mosheh (assume step 1 done)
    sudo zpool create -f mosheh /dev/vdd1
    done.
   )
2.4. Do: sudo zpool status. You see the device you have just added to the pool (data) listed with others, e.g. vdd1 ONLINE 0 0 0
2.5. Do: sudo zpool list. You should see that your zfs pool size has grown
2.6. Do. sudo zfs create data/mynewdirectory (This will create a folder in pool folder. This is not necessary, however its good to
orginise your file system folders in the zfs pool
