1.Rename git tags
	git tag new old
	git tag -d old
	git push origin :refs/tags/old
	git push --tags

2. Then let others do the following to clean local tags and pull remote tags
   git tag -l | xargs git tag -d
   git fetch

3. show tags with 9 lines of message
   git tag -n9

4. push a new branch to remote
   git push -u origin feature_branch_name

5. Delete remote branch
   git push --delete <remote_name> <branch_name>
   e.g. git push --delete origin my-branch

6. Delete locak branch
   git branch -d <branch_name> or git branch -D <branch_name>
   e.g. git branch -d my-branch

Note: The -d option is an alias for --delete, 
which only deletes the branch if it has already been fully merged 
in its upstream branch. You could also use -D, which is an alias for --delete --force, 
which deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status."
